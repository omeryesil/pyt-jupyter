# Using Python in Finance and Investment 

Contains examples, notes from Udemy Course [Python for Finance: Investment Fundamentals & Data Analytics"](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-finance-investment-fundamentals-data-analytics/)
I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning Python (from zero), and using Python in Finance, Investments and Data Analytics.
