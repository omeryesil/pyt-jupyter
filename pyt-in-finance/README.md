# Using Python in Finance and Investments 

Contains examples, notes from Udemy Course [Python for Finance: Investment Fundamentals & Data Analytics"](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-finance-investment-fundamentals-data-analytics/)
I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning Python (from zero), and using Python in Finance, Investments and Data Anlyticss. 


## Financial Data

Up-to-date Financail Data Sources:
- Yahoo Finance (Python 2-3)
- OR Morningstar (Python 2-3)
- OR Alpha Vantage (Python 2-3)
- OR iex (Python 3)

The Udemy course also provides CSV files which can be used to source financial data, however, of course they are not upto-date.
