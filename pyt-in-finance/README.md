# Using Python in Finance and Investment 

Contains examples, notes from Udemy Course [Python for Finance: Investment Fundamentals & Data Analytics"](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-finance-investment-fundamentals-data-analytics/)
I certainly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn using Python for Finance.
